# reclanc

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

reclanc is a revival of [ClaNC (Classification of microarrays to nearest
centroids), by Alan R.
Dabney](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti681).

Since the source has been lost (at least to my knowledge), the code
comes from [here](https://github.com/naikai/sake/blob/master/R/clanc.R)
with heavy modification.

## Installation

You can install the development version of reclanc like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("KaiAragaki/reclanc")
```
