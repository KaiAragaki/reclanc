# Introduction

In this vignette I'll go over how to *use* `reclanc`. If you want information on the algorithm itself and *how it works*, see the blog post I wrote [here](https://kai.rbind.io/posts/projects-reclanc/) as well as the original paper written by Alan Dabney [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/21/22/4148/194954?login=false).


# Input

`reclanc` can take input from the following classes: 

- `data.frame`/`tibble`
- `matrix`
- `SummarizedExperiment`
- `ExpressionSet`
- `recipe`



```{r}
