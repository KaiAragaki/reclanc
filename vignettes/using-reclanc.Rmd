# Fitting

To create new centroids from existing expression data, use the `clanc` function.

`reclanc` provides some synthetic expression data that we can work with:

```r
lapply(synthetic_expression, head)
```

These data include 10 samples, 5 of class "A" and 5 of class "B", with 100 genes.

`reclanc` is able to ingest a variety of common formats for expression data. One common format for expression is the `SummarizedExperiment`:

```r
se <- SummarizedExperiment(
  synthetic_expression$expression,
  colData = DataFrame(class = synthetic_expression$classes)
)
```
