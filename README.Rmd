# reclanc

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

reclanc is a revival of [ClaNC (Classification of microarrays to nearest centroids), by Alan R. Dabney](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti681).

Since the source has been lost (at least to my knowledge), the code comes from [here](https://github.com/naikai/sake/blob/master/R/clanc.R) with heavy modification.

## Installation

You can install the development version of reclanc like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("KaiAragaki/reclanc")
```

## How it works

You can find a more in-depth and statistically rigorous definition of how this algorithm works [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti681).
