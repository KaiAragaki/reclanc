Description: Classification of microarrays to nearest centroids (ClaNC)
  <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti756> selects optimal genes for centroids,
  similar to Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) but using fewer
  corrective factors, resulting in greater sensitivity and accuracy.
  Unfortunately, the original source of ClaNC can no longer be found. 'reclanc'
  reimplements this algorithm, with the the additional benefit of increased
  interoperability with standard data structures and modeling ecosystems.
